## Current priority — 2026-09-09

Build and verify a strong battle bot before developing the coaching app. The target
is **1700+ Elo on the public Champions Reg M-C ladder**; Elo is the ladder's playing-strength
rating. Current models are experimental and have not demonstrated that target.

Work proceeds through trustworthy data and training, current offline strength checks,
local battle checks, and then controlled public ladder sessions with saved replays,
results, and exact model identities. Copying the teacher or passing offline checks does
not establish the target rating; actual ladder results must do that. Coaching interface
and product work are deferred until the playing goal is demonstrated.

Current repair plan: [audit implementation plan](docs/audit_implementation_plan_2026-09-07.md).
Current model inventory: [model register](data/models/registry.json).
The older pipeline and commands below describe historical development and must not be
treated as current release approval.

A rules-first Pokémon Showdown bot for the Champions VGC 2026 Reg M-C doubles ladder
(`gen9championsvgc2026regmc`). It uses the Champions mod's exported data, a
simulator-checked damage engine, and an explicit one-turn evaluator before any learned
components are introduced. Champions data was re-exported for M-C on 2026-09-09.
Public M-C replays are still scarce; the large M-B replay tree is kept as a warm-start
corpus and new rated M-C games are added incrementally. Usage priors stay M-B until
the M-C corpus is large enough to rebuild them.

## Full learning pipeline

The learned bot has one end-to-end, default-off path. Current work follows the
[audit implementation plan](docs/audit_implementation_plan_2026-09-07.md); the
outcome-based RL scaling recipe is closed pending a new hypothesis.

1. exact Champions rules and our complete six-Pokemon team;
2. public high-level replays for an initial human-like state representation;
3. full joint-action imitation from the simulator-backed search teacher;
4. reinforcement learning against mixed opponents, old model snapshots, and varied teams;
5. a held-out-team promotion gate; and
6. explicit checkpoint deployment to local smoke or public ladder games.

Opponent information stays fogged. Revealed moves, items, abilities, move order, and
damage update a probability distribution over plausible hidden sets; the model never
reads the simulator's private opponent state. Every legal doubles order also receives
raw damage, knockout, Speed, threat, Protect, switching, targeting, and coordination
facts from the rules engine.

The shipped heuristic remains the default for local and offline play. Public ladder
sessions that use a learned model need `--policy-mode hybrid`, a named compatible
checkpoint, and current release approval; a saved file is not approval. See
[`docs/full_learning_pipeline.md`](docs/full_learning_pipeline.md) for the commands,
data boundaries, measured smoke results, and promotion rules.

## Post-game analyzer in Codespaces

The `feature/game-analyzer-v1` branch can be run away from the home development
machine through GitHub Codespaces. Its devcontainer installs Python 3.12, Node 22,
project dependencies, and the pinned Champions Showdown checkout automatically.

Create Codespaces secrets `VGC_SHOWDOWN_USERNAME` and `VGC_SHOWDOWN_PASSWORD`, open
a Codespace from that branch, then run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python offline/check_remote_analyzer_ready.py
.venv/bin/python offline/play_and_analyze.py --team teams/recksal_mc.packed.txt
```

The second command lets the human choose every action and writes a verified post-game
report under `runs/game-analyzer-real/`. See
[`docs/game_analyzer_v1.md`](docs/game_analyzer_v1.md) for the input/evidence contract.

## Local verification

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -m integration
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .
```

The project automatically selects an installed Node 22 executable. Set `VGC_NODE` if
Node 22 lives somewhere unusual.

## Offline evaluation

Start the sibling Showdown server, then run the two acceptance gates. July 2026
thresholds below are **M-B-era**; rerun on M-C before treating pass/fail as current
strength.

```bash
.venv/bin/python offline/run_gates.py --candidate vgc --incumbent random --n 100 \
  --threshold 0.90 --team teams/meta1.packed.txt
.venv/bin/python offline/run_gates.py --candidate vgc --incumbent heuristic --n 300 \
  --threshold 0.65 --team teams/meta1.packed.txt
```

Both players explicitly accept Open Team Sheets by default. Use
`--no-open-team-sheets` to make both reject for a controlled comparison.

## Curated metagame teams

`data/meta/popular_teams_H8v7TEZcbXo.json` contains the ten teams shown in JoeUX9's
"The Most Popular Teams In Pokemon Champions Explained" (2026-07-15, **Reg M-B**):
60 complete sets plus the stated roles and common leads. Treat it as historical
archetype hints, not an M-C metagame map. At team preview, `vgc.meta` recognizes only
an exact six-species match. The evaluator then uses the video's hidden nature for its
Speed and damage estimates and records the archetype in `VGC_TRACE` output.

Live Open Team Sheet information always wins for moves, items, and abilities. The video
did not provide Stat Point spreads, so those still come from `data/usage/spreads.json`.
Validate the curated ids against the Champions export with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c 'from vgc.meta import validate_meta_teams; assert not validate_meta_teams()'
```

## Ladder sessions

First exercise the replay, trace, and JSONL logging pipeline locally:

```bash
.venv/bin/python ladder/run_ladder.py --local-smoke --n 2
```

For the public ladder, provide credentials through environment variables:

```bash
export VGC_SHOWDOWN_USERNAME='your-account'
export VGC_SHOWDOWN_PASSWORD='your-password'
.venv/bin/python ladder/run_ladder.py --n 1
```

Alternatively create the gitignored `.showdown-credentials.json`:

```json
{"username": "your-account", "password": "your-password"}
```

Use owner-only permissions (`chmod 600 .showdown-credentials.json`). Replays and
decision traces go under `runs/ladder/`; one outcome record per game is appended to
`runs/ladder.jsonl`. Start with small, respectful sessions.
